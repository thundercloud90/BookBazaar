## Node.js REST API Using MYSQL 

This is my first project using Node. It was designed to work with a 
particular mysql database allowing both a website and a mobile app
to access the database. It's not a perfect API as a lot more error 
checking would be done on the server. But for this project the error 
checking was all done on the front end. In hinde site we should have
done it differently.

##### How to run the server:

1. Download Node.js from the main Node website, just search for it on google.
2. Open the command line or console and cd to this server's directory.
3. Type **npm install**.
4. Once that completes type **node app.js**.
5. The server should now be running on your localhost. 

#####You can access the different APIs by using HTTP GET and POST to this
#####base URL: 

1. On your local machine: localhost:3000 
2. Not local... : (ip address):3000

You can then access the different APIs with extensions like /book or /user.
